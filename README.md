# TA Application Website
Summary: We are designing a better TA application website with functionalities that include resume hosting, filtering based on different criteria, and customization of the TA application form for each class that will function as the primary way that students seeking TAships communicate with instructors as opposed to emails that make it difficult for professors to keep track of potential candidates.
